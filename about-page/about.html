        <h1>John Waugh</h1>
        <h2>Appalachian State 26' B.S. Computer Science</h2>
        <p>As a Computer Science student at Appalachian State University, I am passionate about learning and applying
            new technologies and skills to solve real-world problems. I have completed multiple online courses and
            certifications in Python and HTML5, which I use to develop and improve web applications and embedded
            systems.
            <br><br>
            Currently, I am an Embedded Systems Engineer and a Race Operations Sub Lead at Team Sunergy, the
            university's solar vehicle team. In this role, I work with a multidisciplinary team of students and faculty
            to design, build, and race solar-powered cars. I am responsible for debugging and enhancing the telemetry
            systems that monitor and display the car's data, as well as representing the team at university events,
            brainstorming and planning fundraising and sponsorship strategies, and recruiting new team members through
            social media and advertisements.
            <br><br>
            I have also assumed the role of Composites Specialist at Team Sunergy, which includes the design and
            fabrication of structurally strong and lightweight components made from composite materials (fiberglass,
            kevlar, flax, carbon fiber), and also the utilization of techniques such as vacuum bagging, resin infusion,
            and wet layup molding/compression molding.
            <br><br>
            Previously, I was a Sales Associate at Play It Again Sports, where I gained valuable experience in sales,
            customer relations, and equipment delivery logistics.
            <br><br>
            I am looking for internship opportunities in various computer science-related fields, such as embedded
            systems, full-stack web design, and web app development. I am eager to learn from and contribute to
            innovative and impactful projects.
