            <h1>John Waugh</h1>
            <h2>Appalachian State 26' B.S. Computer Science</h2>
            <p>As a Computer Science student at Appalachian State University, I am passionate about learning and
                applying new technologies and skills to solve real-world problems.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I am an Embedded Systems Engineer and a Race Operations Sub Lead at Team Sunergy, the
                University's Solar Vehicle Team. In this role, I work with a multidisciplinary team of students and
                faculty to design, build, and race solar-powered cars. I am responsible for debugging and enhancing the
                telemetry systems that monitor and display the car's data, as well as representing the team at
                university events, brainstorming and planning fundraising and sponsorship strategies, and recruiting new
                team members through social media and advertisements.
                <br><br>
                I am also the Composites Specialist at Team Sunergy. In this role, I design and fabricate structurally
                strong and lightweight components made from composite materials (fiberglass, kevlar, flax, carbon
                fiber), utilizing techniques such as vacuum bagging, resin infusion, and wet layup molding/compression
                molding.
                <br><br>
                In my academic degree program, relevant courses I have taken include Data Structures and Algorithms,
                Software Engineering, Computer Systems, Technical Writing, and Statistical Data Analysis. Outside of the
                classroom, I have completed various online courses and certifications to strengthen my software
                development skills.
                <br><br>
                In my free time, I enjoy skateboarding, snowboarding, soccer, and watching motorsports, particularly
                Formula 1.
                <br><br>
                I am looking for an internship opportunity in a computer science-related field, such as full-stack web
                development, embedded systems, quantitative development, or UI design. I am eager to learn from and
                contribute to innovative and impactful projects.
