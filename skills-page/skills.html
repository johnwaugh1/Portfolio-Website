                <p>Java was the first programming language I learned, as it is the introductory language
                    for computer science majors at App State. I am very familiar with it, and have been coding
                    projects and coursework with it for 2+ years. Out of every language, I am most comfortable with Java.

            <div class="panel-back" id="python">
                <p>Python was the next language I learned after Java, and I have used it more when completing coursework than
                    personal projects. I have mainly used Python to connect to MySQL databases remotely and locally using the PyMySQL
                    module. I plan on exploring the language more in personal projects.

            <div class="panel-back" id="sql">
                <p>I am fairly familiar with SQL, using it mainly in my coursework, paired with
                    MySQL to design and manage a database for a fictional company, the code for which
                    you can find on my GitHub. Overall, SQL was a fun language to work with, and I enjoyed
                    the process of data management.

                <p>I am very familiar with HTML, CSS, and JS, and many of my projects have some elements of
                    these languages in them. I am actually coding this website entirely using these three languages.
                    Full-stack web development is one of my top interests, as I love combining the front-end creative
                    design with the back-end logic.

            <div class="panel-back" id="c">
                <p>C is a language that I have used in one project and also in my relevant coursework, so I am
                    familiar with it. I mainly used it to create a basic state machine which gets flashed onto
                    microcontroller, which is able to read data and tell the user which state the machine is in via
                    a combination of flashing LEDs.

            <div class="panel-back" id="r">
                <p>R is the language I am least familiar with, but I have a solid understanding of what
                    it can be used for, as I used it for a few months in a statistical data analysis course. It was
                    interesting to see its capabilities, and I may include it in a project which deals with table creation
                    in the future.
